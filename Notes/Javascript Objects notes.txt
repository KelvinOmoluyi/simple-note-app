Auto-boxing are special methods that strings a kept in to be edited by methods

Objects are references to a particular value, hence when const is used for them
they don't bring error if you change the value of the object, they indicate error if you 
change the reference

Destructuring

Functions can be passed into objects

shorthand object properties

Shorthand objects method

ways to update objects
let name = {
	"no1":"john"
	}

1. name.no1 = "Doe"
2. name['no1'] = "Doe"

You can't break out of a forEach() loop using break; better use a for loop as it can break

Normal function syntax permits hoisting, "Ability to call the function without declaring it yet"
